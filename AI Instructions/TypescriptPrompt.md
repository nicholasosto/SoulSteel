I'm working on a Roblox game project where the main objective is for players to explore different worlds and collect items. Hereâ€™s what I need:

1. **Feature Context**: 
   - We already have a basic framework where players can teleport to different worlds.
   - The current currency system tracks coins, which players use to unlock items.

2. **New Feature Request**:
   - I want to add a "Daily Challenges" system that rewards players for logging in and completing certain tasks (e.g., collecting 50 coins, defeating 5 AI enemies, etc.).
   - After each completed challenge, players should receive either coins or a randomized rare item.
   - There should be a daily reset for new challenges.

3. **Requirements**:
   - Use TypeScript with roblox-ts. 
   - Provide the code in modular format (e.g., separate modules/classes for challenge logic, reward logic, etc.).
   - Clearly explain how to integrate this new feature with the existing coin system.
   - Outline the steps to implement a daily reset mechanic (time tracking, resetting challenges, etc.).
   - Include example usage code in the main script to demonstrate how the system is initialized and tested.

4. **Output Format**:
   - Provide an overview/explanation first, then separate code blocks for each relevant module.
   - Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks and label them as TypeScript for clarity (e.g., ```ts).
   - End with a brief bullet list summarizing potential improvements or extensions for the future.

5. **Important Details**:
   - Keep code well-commented to explain reasoning behind key lines.
   - Assume we have a centralized DataStore or a server script managing player data. Show how you'd integrate with that for saving/loading challenge status.
   - If you reference any roblox-ts or Roblox API specifics, note them briefly.

Provide a comprehensive solution that includes these new feature scripts, along with an explanation of how they interconnect with the existing game framework.
