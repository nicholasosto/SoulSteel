## **Introduction**

SoulSteel is an action RPG set in a world divided into four distinct domains, each with unique lore, environments, inhabitants, and mechanics. This document serves as a foundation for the game's world-building, gameplay design, and coding structure, ensuring consistency in mechanics, UI, and future development.

## **World & Lore Overview**

### **The Four Domains**

The world of SoulSteel is shaped by four primary domains, each representing a different force within the universe:

1. **Blood Domain** – A gothic, war-torn land where warriors draw power from life essence and blood magic.
2. **Saintly Domain** – A celestial realm of divine order, light-infused architecture, and unwavering judgment.
3. **Robotic Domain** – A futuristic, high-tech world ruled by synthetic intelligence and cybernetic enhancement.
4. **Decay Domain** – A ruined wasteland of corruption, entropy, and forgotten horrors that defy death.

Each domain influences gameplay, character abilities, environmental hazards, and faction-based progression.

## **Starting Area & World Design**

### **Option 1: Neutral Starting Hub**

- A central location that represents the convergence of the four domains.
- Features ancient ruins, floating islands, or a celestial rift that marks the beginning of the player's journey.
- Contains portals or pathways leading to the different domains.
- Houses tutorial NPCs, lore repositories, and initial quest givers.

### **Option 2: Domain-Specific Starting Areas**

Each player begins their journey in a domain that aligns with their race and abilities:

- **Blood Domain:** The Crimson Keep, a towering gothic castle filled with warriors and dark rituals.
- **Saintly Domain:** The Ascended Spire, a floating temple glowing with divine energy.
- **Robotic Domain:** The Nexus Core, a sprawling cyber-city ruled by AI overseers.

## **Game Mechanics & Core Systems**

### **Domain Influence System**

Each domain has a fluctuating power level based on player contributions, battles, and constructed structures. Domains can gain or lose influence over time, impacting world events and available abilities.

### **Combat System**

- Fast-paced action RPG mechanics with skill-based dodging, combo attacks, and resource management.
- Each domain has unique combat traits (e.g., Blood Domain gains health from attacks, Decay Domain inflicts corrosion debuffs).

### **Character Progression**

- Players can enhance their abilities through domain-based upgrades.
- Unique skill trees for each race that reflect their origins.

### **World Exploration & Secret Areas**

- Each domain has hidden chambers, underground ruins, and lore-heavy exploration zones.
- Special mechanics like blood rituals (Blood Domain), celestial trials (Saintly Domain), or hacking interfaces (Robotic Domain) unlock deeper layers of the world.

### **UI & Interface Guidelines (Future Implementation)**

- The UI will reflect each domain’s aesthetics, using thematic color schemes, fonts, and iconography.
- The interface should be minimalistic yet immersive, with glowing accents and domain-specific animations.
- All menus should integrate with in-game lore (e.g., Robotic Domain’s UI appears as a data interface, Blood Domain’s UI pulses like a living entity).

## **Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: World-Building & Prototyping**

- Finalize domain lore, key locations, and major NPCs.
- Create the base world map and starting areas.

### **Phase 2: Core Mechanics Implementation**

- Develop combat, domain power systems, and faction-based progression.
- Implement character selection and skill tree functionality.

### **Phase 3: UI & Gameplay Refinements**

- Design interfaces that reflect domain aesthetics.
- Balance player progression, combat mechanics, and exploration incentives.
