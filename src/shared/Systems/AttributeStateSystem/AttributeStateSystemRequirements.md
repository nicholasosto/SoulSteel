# Requirements Document for a TypeScript Design Pattern in Roblox Game Development

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a TypeScript design pattern within the context of Roblox game development. It serves as a guideline for developers and as context for an LLM when processing related design decisions and code generation. The design pattern aims to improve code maintainability, scalability, and clarity.

## Goals and Objectives

- **Modularity:** Ensure the code is organized into reusable and isolated modules.
- **Scalability:** Create a structure that can easily grow with new features.
- **Maintainability:** Simplify debugging and future enhancements through clear patterns.
- **Performance:** Optimize the pattern for efficient game performance on Roblox.

## System Context

The design pattern will be applied within a Roblox game development environment using TypeScript. This includes:

- Integration with Roblox Studio.
- Usage of the [Roblox TypeScript (rbxts)](https://roblox-ts.com/) toolchain.
- Deployment on the Roblox platform.

## Design Pattern Overview

- **Pattern Name:** Component Class (ECS?)
- **Intent:** Improves readability and modularity by centralizing state management of GUI Components
- **Structure:** Should
- **Behavior:**

## Configuration and Environment Setup

This section details the development environment and key configurations:

### Coding Environment

- **IDE/Editor:** Roblox Studio with integrated TypeScript support or Visual Studio Code.
- **Version Control:** Git, with repositories hosted on GitHub or GitLab.
- **Build Tools:**
  - [Roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) for transpiling TypeScript to Luau.
  - Node.js and npm for managing dependencies.

### Coding Language

- **Primary Language:** TypeScript (transpiled to Luau for Roblox)
- **Standards and Guidelines:**
  - Follow [TypeScript best practices](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html).
  - Adhere to Roblox-specific coding conventions as outlined in the Roblox-ts documentation.

### Dependencies

- **Primary Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - Roblox-ts (TypeScript for Roblox)
  - Custom modules for game state management, UI, and event handling.
- **External Tools:**
  - Linter: ESLint configured for TypeScript.
  - Formatter: Prettier for consistent code style.

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Module Structure:**
   - Each component should be encapsulated in its own module.
   - Clear interfaces for communication between modules.
2. **Event Management:**
   - Implement a centralized event system (or Observer pattern) to manage game events.
   - Ensure events are debounced or throttled as needed for performance.
3. **State Management:**
   - Define a state manager to handle the game’s global state.
   - Allow for state changes via well-defined actions and reducers.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Incorporate error logging and recovery strategies within each module.
   - Provide mechanisms for runtime error notifications.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:**
   - The pattern should be optimized for the Roblox runtime environment.
   - Ensure minimal overhead in event processing and state updates.
2. **Scalability:**
   - The architecture must support adding new modules without significant refactoring.
3. **Maintainability:**
   - Code should be documented and include inline comments explaining key sections.
   - Follow consistent naming conventions and design practices.
4. **Testing:**
   - Include unit tests for individual modules and integration tests for the overall system.
   - Use Roblox’s testing frameworks where applicable.

## Testing and Deployment

- **Testing Strategy:**
  - Automated tests via a testing framework integrated into the build pipeline.
  - Manual testing scenarios for gameplay events and state transitions.
- **Deployment:**
  - Continuous integration setup to build and test code before deployment.
  - Final deployment via Roblox Studio with version tagging.
